# BNMIT_CodingClub_TechTalk

Hi,
I had prepared this PPT for one of my talks.
I tried to help students who are new to coding (mostly students pursing their 1st year Bachelorâ€™s degree) understand how to write an effective code after being presented with a problem statement.
Feel free to use the same :)
